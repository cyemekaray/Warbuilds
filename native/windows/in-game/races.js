You sacrifice tech speed, economy, and versatility in order to bully enemies early game. There are not a lot of hard counters to mass grunts and lvl 2 shockwave early in the game. <p> A lot of people would laugh to see you make like ten grunts and run around with that early game, but it can be deceptively powerful at least in the first eight or so minutes of the game. One shotting a line of repair wisps with level two shockwave is very satisfying, as is halling someone with pillage grunts in the first 7-8 minutes.

Among the other 3 races, undead ghouls or fiends are pretty vulnerable to mass grunts that quickly, and if their base is open, you can knock out their haunted gold mine.

        "Once you have a healthy grunt mass, you will focus on getting to 50/50 food, only grunts, and creeping to level 3 tauren chieftain (for level 3 shockwave). And you will spend gold on healing salves to keep your army near full hp, and your hero at full mana when you are ready to attack the enemies. As you get enough gold to build a warmill without slowing down your grunt production, you can build one and get attack and armor upgrades. Also, you might want to add a few more lumber peons once you get to this point. This will allow you to tech or expand a bit easier. But the more peons you get, the fewer grunts you can make under 50 food. <p> The goal of the strategy is to get a fast level 3 hero and be ready to attack the enemy between 5:45 and 6:00 with around 38-41 food, near full hp on all your grunts and hero, and near full mana on your tc. Also, you will want a speed scroll to either get into position faster or escape a bad position faster. I mostly use this strategy in 4v4 random team. Some key points about the strategy: Level 2 shockwave kills a full hp wisp in one shot. It maxes out at 12 targets, which can be heroes, buildings, and ground units. Also, elf ancients only have 2 armor if they don't have nature's blessing. This makes them especially vulnerable to getting destroyed early with shockwave/mass grunts.",
      Variations: [
        'Since this strategy generally becomes very vulnerable past the 8 minute mark, sometimes you will need to transition into some other unit combo later in the game. It is possible to squeeze in a delayed expansion, particularly if you start approaching the no upkeep food limit of 50. But most of your resources will be focused on making mass grunts and keeping them healed along with your hero, and making sure you have full mana when you start attacking enemies. ',

The standard version opens with Blademaster harass, while you fast tech to tier two. Build as many towers as you feel like you need situationally to survive the early game. At tier two (and it's essential that your timings are on point with this build), get a Shadow Hunter, Wind Rider, and Shaman. Once tier three add in a Tauren Chieftain. Your hero spell combination consisting of Lightning Orb (on the BM), Hex, and War Stomp, plus Shaman bloodlusted Wind Rider' envenomed spears, are amazing for disabling and bursting down heroes. Variations include solo Blademaster and replacing Wind Rider for Troll Batrider.",

Batriders can serve as a mobile base arassing force or high burst damage antiair with unstable concotion. And a Kodo Beast can be a strong support unit.

        'Some aspects of this build are flexible. You could build the warmill when your tier 2 tech is around 70% complete, allowing it to finish on time with the tech.

These choices will dictate the type of strategies you can do. The longer your second burrow is delayed, the longer you have to wait to start training your 2nd grunt. This leaves you with a smaller army early, so creeping larger camps or defending bigger rushes  will be more difficult. The earlier you have the voodoo lounge, the faster you can utilize healing salves which when used properly are very cost effective. The earlier you tech though, the quicker you can get access to a 2nd hero and strong support units/items in tier 2. Each choice will have pros and cons.',
        "If you don't want to commit as much to beastiary units, you could replace one beastiary with another production building, like a Spirit Lodge or a Tauren Totem. Or even working with just 1 barracks and 1 beastiary if you want to mass more tier 1 units and tech to tier 3 quickly. Or there is the option to skip the beastiary completely and go for some other mix, perhaps a mix of Grunts, Berzerkers, and spellcasters. Spirit Link is a very powerful ability, and it has a lot of synergy with Healing Wards, Heal Wave, high hp Orc units/heroes, and bigger armies. Of course, doubling down on spellcasters exposes you to more risk of getting countered hard by a skilled player using efficient dispel like disenchant, dispel, or devour magic. Not to mention feedback and spell steal. The Tauren tech path got some improvements in the last few patches. The Tauren Totem can be built in tier 2 now, and it does not require a War Mill to build. Training Taurens still does require a warmill though. And now, Spirit Walkers are build only in the Tauren Totem. That does reduce the versatility of the Spirit Lodge a bit compared to previous patches. But, you make up for it with the potential for earlier Tauren timings, or just having the threat of going Tauren if you've gone Spirit Walkers and then get tier 3.",
        'There are some "cheese" or "troll" type strategies that you can transition into with this build order, like mass raiders, mass batriders, mass windriders, or mass demolishers. With the right unit mix and upgrades, this build order sets you up to be reasonably powerful at most stages of the game.',

The downside is your midgame is generally not as strong as some other races because ghouls have weak stats.

      Analysis:
        "<p> As soon as your lich comes out, you should buy a rod of necromancy, grab 3 or 4 ghouls, and go out creeping quick camps near your base. Scout with skeletons as you continue creeping. After you tech, you will want to build a ziggurat, a graveyard, and then continue building ziggurats until you have 50 supply. Creep to levels 2 and 3 as quickly as you can. The idea is to have a quick power spike when you get an orb and wyrms. It is a bit risky because you won't be adding very much in tier 2 to strengthen your army. I usually save this strategy for 4v4 random team. In theory, with 4 different opponents, and the tendency of players to expand and tower, you will often have at least 1 or 2 opponents who will be vulnerable to this timing window. </p> <p> If your opponents seem to be going for an early or midgame rush, you might have to adjust and start adding fiends, more ghouls, maybe even obsidian statues and a second hero. There are pros and cons to these choices. Going for 2 or 3 heroes is going usually means the experience will be split between them and thus you will have 3 heroes that are lower level than if you just had 1 hero. Also, having only 1 hero in tier 2 or tier 3 grants you an exp bonus. So you will often hit levels 4 and 5 quickly. And then if you kill enough enemy units or towers, lvl 6. </p> <p> The lich has a decent ultimate ability, though it does have the weakness of being a channeling spell. It hits buildings, air and ground units, and heroes in a large area for 4% of their total hitpoints. This can add up to a lot of damage if your channeling isn't interrupted and you hit targets that either aren't moved (or can't move). 250 mana is a lot though, but lvl 2 dark ritual on skeletons or whatnot can help with that. With only 1 hero, you're fairly limited. No death coil to heal the lich, no other heroes to add dps or support spells or auras. If you skip a 2nd and 3rd hero, you're basically picking frost wyrms over them. At first, frost wyrms are comparable to many lvl 1 heroes. But heroes have a huge scaling potential if you can keep them alive as you kill enemy units or heroes. </p><p>I will also say that there are some heroes that even on level 1 have a bigger impact than a frost wyrm in the late game. Some examples include a pitlord with howl of terror, or a panda with drunken haze. In large battles, a debuff giving -30% damage to everything in a big area, or 45% chance to miss and -15% movement speed on a smaller area, can potentially have a bigger impact. However, frost nova with orb of corruption and frost wyrm cold breath + high dps is a lot of burst damage on both air and ground targets. It is best as a timing attack strategy though, trying to punish players who are out of position and/or unprepared for them. Against competent players, in the long run they can be beaten with more efficient unit mixes. And it really starts to snowball when you start losing wyrms and you don't have that high burst damage.</p>",
      Variations: [
        'You can buy 1 or 2 more ghouls for lumber, but you will be saving a lot of gold in order to buy an acolyte to turn into a shade and also tech to tier 3 immediately.',
        'You can also probably afford to get 1 or 2 attack upgrades for frost wyrms (this upgrade will also apply to gargoyles, fiends, and destroyers if you choose to make those at any point).',
        'You could add in a 2nd or 3rd hero, or some units between the transition from ghouls to frost wyrms. There are pros and cons to this though. The main con is that your experience and gold will be split. Trying to mass Frost Wyrms on 1 gold mine basically requires you to devote all of your resources to that, or you just won’t have that many Frost Wyrms. It’s not nearly as difficult to counter 1 or 2 frost wyrms. And you probably won’t be able to mix in Destroyers, which means you will be vulnerable to debuffs like hex, slow, polymorph, etc. With that in mind, sometimes it will make more sense to get fewer Frost Wyrms and get statues that can also morph into destroyers when needed. Statues are powerful support units, though the main goal of the strategy is maximizing burst damage output, which means you’ll probably prefer Destroyers to Statues.',

Once there, make Necromancers and Meat Wagons. Grab a sacrificial skull and load up your wagons with corposes and do an all-in push on the enemy base. Your meat wagons drop their corpses and sit in the back firing from long range. In front of them are necromancers, raising an army of skeletons to act as your frontline. Works well against humans fast expanding. One variation is going Dreadlord and Alchemist for the aura and healing spray, which would work better in big team games. Auto-attack based heroes can synergize well too with Unholy Frenzy. Also, tier one ghouls can help ease your early game but delay your powerspike.",

      Analysis:
        "This is a strategy I sometimes use in elf vs elf solo games. The idea is to harass aggressively with a Demon Hunter and hunts. By exploiting their fast movement speed and strong early game dps, you can sometimes punish players who take riskier creeping patterns and slow moving archers. But I usually stop at 3 huntresses, because my mid and lategame strategy is to quickly get a few Dryads, Naga, and possibly transition to druids of the claw for roar/rejuvenation/bear form or mountain giants. Frost Arrow slow along with dryad slow poison and fast moving units can be strong to secure kills and punish opponents if they are out of position. In battles with fewer units, the Demon Hunter and Naga and Dryads and Druids of the Claw with Adept or Master level are very strong. Abolish Magic can be used to deal with Entangle or  Treants if the opponent is using those. Dryads are strong vs Huntresses. But the main strength of the strategy is the mobility and early tier 2.  <p> One of the downsides of AoW creeping with only 1 or 2 Archers is that you're sacrificing build time in order to tank with your aow. It also often commits your AoW a bit far from your main base. So you can potentially go for wisp kills, or vulnerable Archer kills, while at the same time having more dps vs their heroes with normal attack damage Huntresses. The other common Elf mirror match strategy is to just go PoTM with mass Hunts and Glaive Throwers, often tower rushing with those. The Demon Hunter is very strong heads up against a PoTM, though if you stop at 3 Hunts, there is a timing window where you could be vulnerable to a push. Basically right as you hit tier 2, but don't yet have your Ancients of Lores up/Dryads. Even when your first dryads come out, Glaive Throwers and mass Hunts with trueshot can pressure well. Not to mention the enemy can pressure buildings with glaivethrowers. Often you won't have enough time to smoothly transition if you aren't doing a good job scouting. But, since you will be harassing with your DH immediately, scouting shouldn't be too difficult.",
      Variations: [
        "Once you get to 3 hunts, you want to have a good idea of what the enemy is doing. Are they aggressively creeping, are they doing a mass Huntress / Glaive Thrower strat? Did they go Keeper of the Grove instead for Treants/Entangle? Are they going to try for a fast expand? You want to be prepared to counter them as their strat develops, not having to wait and see their full army before you make counter units. Don't lock yourself into the written build order; instead, learn to adapt",
        'It’s possible to add a 2nd Ancient of War before or during tech and focus more on a big Huntress/Glaive thrower rush, or even transitioning to Archers - > Hippogryph Riders. Naga (with Frost Arrows) used to be one of the standard 2nd heroes in this matchup thanks to her immense pressure, but due to several balance changes for heroes, you could potentially change up the heroes (even going for a Keeper of the Grove first and Alchemist 2nd).',

The pros are it’s a straightforward, and fairly simple strategy to execute. One downside is if you don’t start winning on the push, the human player can generally make strong counter units like spellbreakers or rifles and mortars with upgrades.',

        "The goal is to creep your dark ranger up to lvl 3 quickly, in order to harass the human when you hit tier 2 with dr archers naga. As you tech, continue to train archers until you are at 6. Build a hunters hall and moonwells up to 50 food as you get enough resources. As soon as you hit tier 2, build an ancient of lore and an ancient of wind. Hire a naga seawitch choose frost arrow and push enemy base. Continue building moonwells until you get to 80 supply. Hire dryads, druids of the talon, and archers until you're 50 food. Upgrade abolish magic after your first dryad finishes. Upgrade archer attack range before you build your 7th archer. Upgrade DoTTs to adept after your 3rd DoTT. <p> The goal is to overwhelm the human with mass ranged units + snowball them with skeletons as you start killing units. If the enemy has an arcane tower, avoid it with your heroes/dotts/dryads/skeletons. But if the enemy army isn't in the base you attack, and you can destroy the tower quickly without taking too many hits, it is often very strong to do so. Both militia and footmen are melee and have heavy armor, so you should be able to kite them fairly effectively with black and frost arrow, dryad slow poison, faerie fire, and magic damage. If the enemy has too many footmen, or defend, you could transition to hunts when your hunters hall finishes. Higher hp, faster movement speed, and normal damage attacks that bounce are stronger vs the medium archer spellbreakers. It's also stronger versus peasants, heroes, and buildings.",

Also, if you wanted to skip DoTTs, you could add in Faerie Dragons or Hippogryphs (for Hippogryph Riders) instead. You could also just get 2 Ancients of Lore to double down on Dryads.
